The current goal of this project is to create an API to generate pseudorandom procedural star systems
inspired by Elite Dangerous with a variety of generated info that can be viewed and used by the consumer.

The overall goal of this project is to create a text-based adventure/journaling game set in the deep reaches of space.

The finished game would have an adventure mode that allows you to travel to randomly-generated star systems, face random encounters,
meet NPC characters and learn about their stories, explore and discover galactic mysteries,
and write entries about your adventure in a daily captains-log, which will help you catalogue your experience.

There should also be a freeform mode that allows the player to generate and visit star systems according to their own parameters,
intended as a journaling tool to be paired with actual exploration in Elite Dangerous.
Store system info and written journal logs about your records and other exploration findings, 
use it as a companion app to keep a journal of your expedition, etc.

## Why?

Because I like space, and I want to learn Rust, and I need to learn proper project structuring and management.
This sounded like a fun project to tackle over time now that I've gotten through about half of the Rust Book.
Traits and lifetimes and generics and all that jazz still confuse me a bit, but thankfully the compiler is an absolute bro,
so I've been managing alright thus far.
