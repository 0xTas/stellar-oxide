The current goal of this project is to create an API to generate data resembling pseudorandom procedural star systems
inspired by Elite Dangerous with a variety of generated values that can be viewed and used by the consumer.

Right now it creates stars and planet structures but with lousy linear rng.

So, probably don't use it. It isn't ready yet.

## Why?

Because I like space, and I want to learn Rust, and I need to learn proper project structuring and management.
This sounded like a fun project to tackle over time now that I've gotten through about half of the Rust Book.
Traits and lifetimes and generics and all that still confuse me a bit, but thankfully the compiler is an absolute bro,
so I've been managing alright thus far.
